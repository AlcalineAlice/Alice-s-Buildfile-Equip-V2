/*
Separates the reaver weapons' effect into two
Weapon Ability 2:
0x01 Reverse Weapon Triangle 		//vanilla reaver bit
0x02 Double Weapon Triangle Effect  //this is the disable hammerne bit? perhaps move this to one of the free bits in byte 3 (this was unused in FE7 so it was good when this was for FE7, needs to move now)
*/
//either way this doesn't seem to conflict with anything when placed at FE8 locations, should be changed for moving double WTA to byte 3 0x40 which will change how this is being installed
//ah yeah this just crashes the game when it tries to calc stuff lol need to redo it more

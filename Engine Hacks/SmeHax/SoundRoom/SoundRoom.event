//Sound Room Table is refed in function at 0x80AEC94 to get length of it

//what is at 0x20250BA? this is where sound room length gets stored
//it's proc-related, we'll need to get it storing and loading as something more than a byte so we'll need to break on its interaction
//nothing in the space directly after it means we should be good to just store it as more than a byte and nothing else

//stored as a byte at 0x80AED80 @strb r0,[r2]
//loaded as a byte at 0x80AEE1C @ldrb r1,[r3]
//loaded as a byte at 0x80AF4B8 @ldrb r0,[r0]
//we need to change where it's being stored and read to 0x20250EC; free space in the proc pool and we can store a word there

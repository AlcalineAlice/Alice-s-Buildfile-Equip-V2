Holy blood initiation table (types, index is each def)
+0 - Name ID, 2 bytes
+2 - Desc ID, 2 bytes
+4 - HP growth modifier, 1 byte
+5 - Str growth modifier, 1 byte (also mag if no strmag split)

(growth modifiers are doubled for major blood)
+C - Weapon type to raise level of, 1 byte (S if major, +1 from where it's currently at if minor; if >7, treated as none)
+D - Gives access to dragon veins (ignored if no dragon veins)
+10 - Pointer to exclusive weapon list, 4 bytes (item ID list terminated by FF)

Holy blood assignment table (aligned to character table IDs per entry)
+0 - Holy blood ID (the actual ID is only 8 bits; if the highest bit is set treated as major, otherwise treated as minor)

Todo:
-hook into levelup growths getter and do respective modifiers where applicable (ref strmag split because need to do if that's around too)
-hook into weapon usability and do a check if they're on the list for the user's holy blood
-hook into dragon veins to add this check in addition to the skill check
-hook into unit loading to affect loaded weapon ranks
-integrate into MSS for name and desc display
